# Federated Slurm cluster for EDA
#
# This is the 2nd AZ that must be created after the 1st cluster.
# Shares the SlurmDbd instance from the 1st AZ's cluster.
# Redundant controllers and typical instances used by EDA.
# Uses CentOS 7 and AlmaLinux 8 and both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.
#
# Defaults and valid configuration options are in source/config_schema.py.
# Command line values override values in the config file.
